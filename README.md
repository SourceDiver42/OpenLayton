# OpenLayton
 Open Source reimplementation of the Professor Layton Games


 This is a toy project which is partly reverse engineering the Layton Games and reconstructing the source code to create custom spinoffs. The resources used in the project will to be extracted by the user from the desired ROM when building so no original files will be used to avoid pushing copyrighted material.

 You need ndspy in order to run the ROM extractor scripts.
