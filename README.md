# OpenLayton
 Open Source reimplementation of the Professor Layton Games


 This is a toy project which is partly reverse engineering the Layton Games and rewriting them as homebrews (or your own games). The resources used in the homebrew will be extracted by the user from the desired ROM when building so no original files will be used.

 You ned ndspy in order to run the ROM extractor scripts.
